"""
Test for cci run --persistent - no spurious errors during cleanup.

Tests that:
1. Run with --persistent flag
2. Container stops itself (command completes)
3. Cleanup does not show "Error: The instance is already stopped"

This test validates the fix for the issue where cleanup tried to stop an
already-stopped persistent container, causing spurious error messages.
