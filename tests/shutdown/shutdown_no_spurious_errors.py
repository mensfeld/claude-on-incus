"""
Test for cci shutdown - no spurious errors when container stops during timeout.

Tests that:
1. Launch a container
2. Stop it externally (simulating it stopping during graceful shutdown)
3. Run shutdown with timeout
4. Verify no "Error: The instance is already stopped" message

This test validates the fix for the race condition where a container could
stop during the timeout window, causing spurious error messages when the
force-kill attempt executes.
